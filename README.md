# Hydrogen atom electron shell probability cloud

[Try it](http://puqeko.github.io/hydrogen-prob-cloud/)

A 3d depiction of how electrons probabilistically distribute themselves around a hydrogen atom to form shells.

Toggle the `shouldBeFlat` variable in the file to change between a flat or 3d representation. The flat view is easier to see. Made using [MathBox](https://github.com/unconed/mathbox). Currently the number of points is set at 20,000. Points are rendered in batches. 

Works best in Chrome.
