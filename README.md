A 3d depiction of how electrons probabilistically distribute themselves around a hydrogen atom to form shells.

Toggle the `shouldBeFlat` variable in the file to change between a flat or 3d representation. The flat view is easier to see. Made using MathBox of [acko.net](http://acko.net). Currently the number of points is set at 20,000, points are rendered in batches as it appears MathBox has a limit on the number of points it can render per call. 

Works best in Chrome.
